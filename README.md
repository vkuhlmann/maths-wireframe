# Maths wireframe

The goal of this project is to provide an image generator for 3D shapes as wireframe.
Currently the set-up is still hard coded, and only the basic functionality has been implemented.
Move around with WASD, and look around with the number keys 8462.

I regularly experience ghostkeys unfortunately, that is, you move in a direction without pressing
the key. Pressing that key and releasing it fixes it. I will look in to this issue later in development.
